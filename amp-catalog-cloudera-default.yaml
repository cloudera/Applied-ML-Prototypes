  - title: Churn Modeling with scikit-learn
    label: churn-prediction
    short_description: Build an scikit-learn model to predict churn using customer telco data.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to build a logistic regression classification model to predict the probability 
      that a group of customers will churn from a fictitious telecommunications company. In addition, the model is 
      interpreted using a technique called Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). Both the logistic 
      regression and LIME models are deployed using CML's real-time model deployment capability and interact with a 
      basic Flask-based web application.

  - title: Deep Learning for Image Analysis
    label: image-analysis
    short_description: Build a semantic search application with deep learning models.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to build a scalable semantic search solution
      on a dataset of images. Pretrained convolutional neural networks are used to
      extract semantically meaningful representations, which are then indexed
      using the FAISS library for scalable retrieval. Finally, the project
      launches an interactive visualization for exploring the quality of
      representations extracted using multiple model architectures.
