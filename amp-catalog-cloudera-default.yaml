- title: Churn Modeling with XGBoost
  label: churn
  short_description: Build an XGBoost model to predict churn using customer telco data.
  long_description: >-
    This project demonstrates how to build  classifier models (Logistic
    Regression, Xgboost) to predict the churn probability for a group of
    customers from a telecoms company. In addition, the model can then be
    interpreted using LIME. Both the classifier  and LIME models are then
    deployed using CML's real-time model deployment capability. Finally, a basic
    flask application is deployed that will let you interact with the real-time
    model to see which factors in the data have the most influence on the churn
    probability.

- title: Airline Delay Prediction
  label: airline
  short_description: Flight analytics and cancellation prediction with pyspark and sparklyr.
  long_description: >-
    This project creates an API that can predict the likelihood of a flight
    being cancelled based on historic flight data. The original dataset comes
    from Kaggle. The project shows both the pyspark and sparklyr implementations
    and covers: Importing Data Data Science and Exploration Data Engineering ML
    Model Building and Optimisation ML Model Training ML Model Serving Deploying
    an Application.

- title: Deep Learning for Image Analysis
  label: image-analysis
  short_description: Build a semantic search application with deep learning models.
  long_description: >-
    This project demonstrates how to build a scalable semantic search solution
    on a dataset of images. Pretrained convolutional neural networks are used to
    extract semantically meaningful representations, which are then indexed
    using the FAISS library for scalable retrieval. Finally, the project
    launches an interactive visualization for exploring the quality of
    representations extracted using multiple model architectures.

- title: Neural Question Answering
  label: neuralqa
  short_description: >-
    Launch a visual interface for neural question answering. Supports BERT
    models, information retrieval methods (ElasticSearch, Solr).
  long_description: >-
    This project demonstrates how the Cloudera Fast Forward Labs NeuralQA
    library can be used to bootstrap an application for neural question
    answering. The application interface integrates visualizations for
    explaining model behaviour and contextual query expansion.

- title: Structural Time Series
  label: structural-time
  short_description: Applying Bayesian STS to California hourly electricity demand data.
  long_description: >-
    This project provides an example application of generalized additive models
    (via the Prophet library) to California hourly electricity demand data. The
    primary output of this repository is a small application exposing a
    probablistic forecast and interface for asking a probabilistic question
    against it.

- title: Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection
  label: anomaly-detection
  short_description: Build a semantic search application with deep learning models.
  long_description: >-
    This project includes implementations of several neural networks
    (Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder, Bidirectional GAN, Sequence Models)
    applied to the task of anomaly detection in Tensorflow 2.0. For comparison,
    it includes two baselines (One Class SVM, PCA) and provides a frontend
    interface for exploring model results.

- title: Fraud Detection
  label: fraud-detection
  short_description: Build a semantic search application with deep learning models.
  long_description: >-
    In this project, a fictional credit card company uses machine learning to
    identify fraudulent transactions that should be blocked or investigated.
    Although the features in this dataset are abstract, in principle, post hoc
    analysis could also surface fraud hotspots that could be communicated as an
    alert to customers. The techniques in this use case are applicable to any
    situation in which most measurements or events are normal, but rare outliers
    require attention.

- title: Sentiment Analysis with Sparklyr and Tensorflow
  label: sentiment-analysis
  short_description: Build R and Python models for sentiment analysis with Spark.
  long_description: >-
    This project builds two different Sentiment Analysis models. One model is
    based on text from the Simpsons TV show available on Kaggle here and uses R
    code (specifically Sparklyr) to train the model. The other model is based on
    the Sentiment 140 dataset, also available on kaggle here and uses Python
    Code (specifically Tensorflow with GPU). The end result is an application
    that will send a test sentence to either of the deployed models and show the
    predicted sentiment result.
