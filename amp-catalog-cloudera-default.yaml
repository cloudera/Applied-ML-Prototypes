  - title: Knowledge Graph powered RAG based QA application
    label: llm-kg-rag-qa
    short_description: |
      A Knowledge-graph enhanced RAG application to answer your AI/ML related questions.
    long_description: |
      This AMP spins up a knowledge graph powered RAG application which has the capability to answer AI/ML questions drawing from the latest research publications. The knowledge base consists of ~650 AI/ML papers from arXiv, and the citation relationships between them are captured as "edges" in the knowledge graph, which is powered by Neo4j. Additional information from knowledge graph is used to better rerank text chunks retrieved by vector search and also suggest related papers from the answer to assist user's research.

  - title: TensorBoard as a CML Application
    label: tensorboard
    short_description: Demonstration of how to use TensorBoard as a CML Application.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to run a TensorBoard dashboard as an application inside CML. To facilitate the demo, a minimal script is run to train a neural network
      on the MNIST digits data set while capturing logs that are visualized in the TensorBoard application.

  - title: Continuous Model Monitoring
    label: continuous-model-monitoring
    short_description: Demonstration of how to perform continuous model monitoring on CML using Model Metrics and Evidently.ai dashboards.
    long_description: >-
      To combat concept drift in production systems, its important to have robust monitoring capabilities that alert 
      stakeholders when relationships in the incoming data or model have changed. In this Applied Machine Learning 
      Prototype (AMP), we demonstrate how this can be achieved on CML. Specifically, we leverage CML's Model Metrics 
      feature in combination with Evidently.ai's Data Drift, Numerical Target Drift, and Regression Performance reports 
      to monitor a simulated production model that predicts housing prices over time.

    short_description: A demonstration of how the NLP task of text style transfer can be applied to enhance the human writing experience using HuggingFace Transformers and Streamlit.
    long_description: >-
      The goal of this application is to demonstrate how the NLP task of text style transfer can be applied to enhance the human writing experience. In this sense, 
      we intend to peel back the curtains on how an intelligent writing assistant might function — walking through the logical steps needed to automatically re-style a piece of text 
      (from informal-to-formal or subjective-to-neutral) while building up confidence in the model output.
